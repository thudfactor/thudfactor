We all need better ways to keep track of our bookmarks. Here are the things I read I continued to think about long afterwards.

These link roundups are likely to be somewhat scattershot and themes will no doubt change from installment to installment. I'm going to try not to link to paywalled stuff unless I can also provide a gift link.

### Cool

[1980s computer books from Usborne](https://usborne.com/us/books/computer-and-coding-books)
: Usborne has several fun-looking computer programming books geared towards the children of the 1980s, including general programming education & game listings. None of these books look familiar _specifically_, but I would have loved to have some of these when I was a kid.

### Politics

[The Lie of 'Self-Reliance' in Appalachia: How It's Used to Keep Us Down](https://appalachianmemories.org/2025/06/26/the-lie-of-self-reliance-in-appalachia-how-its-used-to-keep-us-down/)
: Propaganda is alive and well, and one of the best ways to convince people not to demand help is to insist that asking for (or insisting on!) help is a personal flaw. While this is deeply ingrained in the culture here in Appalachia, it's by no means unique to the region nor limited to a specific economic class. You can see echoes of this on "Why Employees Work While Sick," linked further below.

### Accessibility

[Making Scannable Web Pages for Assistive Technology](https://coforma.io/perspectives/making-scannable-web-pages-for-assistive-technology)
: We've had quite a few tools released recently that promise automatic code generation, but they often fail when it comes to semantic markup. Unfortunately, so do we humans. Jarad Cunha's deep dive into how to make web pages scannable in screen readers is a big help, and I'll be applying many of these suggestions to personal and professional projects currently under my hand.

_Paid Course:_ [Sara Soueidan's Practical Accessibility](https://practical-accessibility.today/)
: I've been working my way through Sara's accessibility course over the last week or so and learning a lot. Much of it is stuff I _should_ have known before. Sara's course is paid but well worth the price. (This is an unsolicited recommendation and _not_ an affiliate link.)

### Working with AI

[Generative AI Runs on Gambling Addition](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/05/generative-ai-runs-on-gambling-addiction-just-one-more-prompt-bro/)
: This isn't precisely the metaphor I've been using. In my experience, generative AI feels a lot like _Civilization VI_ and other 4X games. "Just one more turn!" But I'm not a gambler, and David Gerard's metaphor is probably more relatable.

[After months of coding with LLMs, I'm going back to using my brain](https://albertofortin.com/writing/coding-with-ai)
: Alberto Fortin, an experienced developer who's been using generative AI for a long time, explains how he over-extended AI's usefulness as a coding partner, and how to better think of using the tool. There's also a [companion webcast with Zed Industries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOQmhkLGcuY).

### Business Topics

_Gift Link:_ [Why Employees Work While Sickâ€”and How Leaders Can Stop It](https://hbr.org/2025/06/research-why-employees-work-while-sick-and-how-leaders-can-stop-it?giftToken=8607343311751456132835)
: Perhaps your reaction was like mine: "people are told to work sick, just stop telling them." But this investigates _why_ people who _are_ allowed to take sick leave often don't. Or worse, take the sick leave but continue to push through it. This is a more subtle problem.

[Why Engineers Hate Their Managers (And What to Do About It)](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/06/24/why-engineers-hate-their-managers-and-what-to-do-about-it/)
: I've had good managers and bad managers, and most of the ones in-between at least were struggling with unreasonable expectations and arbitrary constraints out of their control -- and were just bad at communicating those things. Matheus Lima's post is a plea for empathy on both sides.

[How Tech Loses Out](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/how-tech-loses-out/)
: A transcript of Bert Hubert's talk about companies hollowing out their innovation capabilities by outsourcing _all_ of the production efforts. "I used to sell software, and now I sell services, because no one can buy my software anymore, because none of these
telecommunications companies are technical companies anymore."

[MTTR: Bullshit Masquerading as Operational Efficiency](https://medium.com/@Hatchman76/mttr-bullshit-masquerading-as-operational-efficiency-bc06fda12207)
: Andrew Hatch's deep dive into why "Mean Time to Recovery," a common metric for measuring incidence response effectiveness, is not particularly useful. This specific topic is a bit out of my wheelhouse, but it's a good discussion of why "throw a bunch of numbers in a spreadsheet and get a pretty chart" is of dubious value.
