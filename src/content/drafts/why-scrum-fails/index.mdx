title: Why scrum fails
---

I've been practicing scrum for over a decade now; for the first five years for a company that either could not or would not (opinions differ) accept scrum principles as vital to the process. The second for a company dedicated to those principles from probably the top down. Scrum did not work in the former, but it does work in the latter. The principles matter. This is not a new observation; it is practically the first hour of the first day of the CSM training program.

From my perspective, Scrum has had a 50% success rate — but many developers feel that scrum is a failure. Not just that, but that scrum and agile in general are abusive, pushing developers into burnout while shorting crucial code-quality and maintenance tasks. As someone who believes [all creative work is “agile”](https://www.thudfactor.com/posts/2019/11/humanities/) _and_ as someone who has been all-in on scrum for many years, it's upsetting to realize that my experience is so atypical. But it's hard to deny the lived experience of so many others.

But all creative work _is_ agile, and scrum _should_ and _does_ work (at least occasionally), so where is the disconnect?

Today, drinking coffee made out of a K-cup while on vacation, I think I stumbled on the answer. But we need to back up a bit.

## A Capitalism Fairy-tale

Once upon a time, a Businessman saw people struggling with a daily task. It doesn't matter what task, for the purpose of convenience we can say the task is "making a to-do list." The Businessman thought to himself, "I can make the best to-do lists in the world! I should just make my system available to everyone for a price. They will get better to-do lists, and I can buy the Fanciest Keurig Machine In the World, everybody wins!"

And so he did that, and it was a very good way to make to-do-lists, and everyone liked it and the Businessman got rich.

But then one day an Entrepreneur came along and said "I know how to make better to-do lists, but the Businessman won't make these changes because he is making enough money. But _I can_ make, and I can lower the price, and then I will get at least some of the money the Businessman was making. And the Entrepreneur did, and he took some of the Businessman's customers and got new ones also because the new ones _didn't_ like the Businessman's to-do lists because they weren't in cursive and the Entrepreneur's was.

"Oh no," thought the Businessman, "even though I already have The Fanciest Keurig Machine In the World, there may some day be a fancier one. I will want that, too. I better keep making money." So he, too, improved his to-do list. And he got some of the Entrepreneur's customers and some new ones besides.

And so, through competition, the Businessman and the Entrepreneur kept making their products better and better, they both continued to make money, and everyone (including their customers, whose to-do lists had never been better) lived happily ever after.

## It's a nice theory

In fairy-tale capitalism, there is really only one strategy for wealth: identify a need, fulfill it, and make a fair profit. This is the version that many of us still believe in our hearts, if not our minds. You can tell this because we say things like "Amazon has stopped letting us download ebooks, we will show them by shopping someplace else."

There are two distorting
