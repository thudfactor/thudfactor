description: An explanation and apology of sorts for things looking like 1992 around here.

Hey! If you are seeing this post right now, things probably look rather… unstyled. I’ve gone super retro for the moment as I redesign things around extremely modern markup and CSS.

My intention here is to get things looking as readable and useful as I can with extremely minimal CSS. This will be my laboratory for semantic HTML and good ARIA markup where needed.

Then my plan is to start (slowly) layering on CSS using cascade layers and custom properties. First the layout, then other niceties.

I’ll update this post as I make progress, at least until thinks look considerably less raw. Until then, enjoy the nostalgia.
