Today I have some more thoughts on moving from VSCode to Neovim. If you want to read from the beginning, [here is the first post](https://thudfactor.com/posts/2024/05/vim-1/).

It didn't take me too long to realize that trying to switch entirely from VSCode to Neovim was risky both to my daily effectiveness at work and my mental stability, so I am continuing to use Neovim inside VSCode, and focusing on making good use of the few keystrokes I've learned before moving on. I am a bit impatient, but being impatient about learning new things did not serve me well in either learning to draw or learning the guitar, so I am forcing myself to take it slow.

One advantage I have over learning guitar or drawing is that it's actually my day job to write code, and it was never job to doodle or noodle. In other words, I have plenty of opportunity to practice. I really appreciate being able to delete whole words at a time without having to do much more than move the cursor in place and hit a few keys. I don't know if I am faster, but I certainly feel faster.

One thing I've been asking myself, though: why am I putting in all of this effort? Hasn't VSCode been good enough for me until now? Is it just bordom that's driving me to learn an obscure skill? (It wouldn't be the first time for sure.) But now I think I know what was tickling my brain about the need to move on from VSCode.

## We are in silly season for commercial products

The AI fad is entirely out of control. I've seen so many companies trying to inject AI into everything that they do, despite significant and increasing evidence that AI simply replaces much of the labor of creation with the labor of revision. A lot of us feel like AI is being forced on us, but — to be fair — a lot of businesses have bought into the hype that they better board the LLM train or be the last ones standing on the platform.

This is not limited to AI, however. It has become increasingly common for businesses to "innovate" new features which they then market after-the-fact, trying to push them on unwilling users. The more dominant the product, the more likely it is that you will have features forced on you whether you are interested or not.

One example I can think of here is the use of digital displays in vehicles for basic tasks previously done with knobs and switches. There's very little benefit to drivers, for making this change, but it seems like everyone's decided to do this anyway — without considerations for safety.

We are also seeing increasing evidence that a products users are frequently marketed as an unpaid (or worse, _paying_) resource to be sold to other companies. I am not only thinking here of Reddit licensing all of its post archives to AI engines, but how auto-makers have been leveraging the connected, digital interfaces they've created to collect vast amounts of telemetry data they can [sell to marketers and insurance companies](https://theconversation.com/cars-are-a-privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-heres-how-they-get-away-with-collecting-and-sharing-your-data-214386) while _at the same time_ turning things like [heated seats and keyless fobs](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/13/23206999/car-subscription-nightmare-heated-seats-remote-start) into features that require a monthly subscription. Both of my cars are too old for this sort of nonsense, but I can easily imagine a feature where every time you start up your car you have to dismiss a chat bubble or watch an ad for these subscription services before you can hit the road.

While I was thinking about writing this update, [Adobe changed their terms of service](https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/06/change-to-adobe-terms-amp-conditions/), implying that they could see, and use, anything you created with their software. The backlash was loud and immediate, so now Adobe is [“clarifying” the terms](https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/07/adobe-terms-clarified/), although I don't think anyone can be blamed for thinking they were trying to pull a fast one on us.

## The open-source hope

When looking for an alternative text editor, it was _absolutely_ in the back of my mind that Microsoft was beginning to leverage VSCode and Github's market dominance to monetize their users through multiple vectors, while at the same time trying to [force an AI-centered developer experience](https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/) that, at best, is simply not ready for us.

VSCode’s core is open source to be sure, but it's open source the same way Chrome or Safari is open-source: the code is mostly open, but the projects are tied very tightly to corporate interests. So Google can leverage Chrome to [shut down ad blockers](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/) that threaten their main product (your eyeballs). What will happen to VSCode? Microsoft certainly does not have a stellar reputation for centering consumer interests over advertising at them.

Concerns about this, in fact, led me to look at and then dismiss [Zed](https://zed.dev/) as an editor. It is nominally open-source, but the creators have expressed an intention to make subscription-based features a significant part of the product.

These tools are too important to me on a daily basis for them to become subject to the kind of nonsense-squishing I have to do on _practically every website I visit_. I don’t want to open my editor and be subjected to a forced tour of features I won't use, or having all of my work broadcast to a central location for AI training and marketing analysis. I want a peaceful place where I can do my work _and_ my hobby without feeling like I am both a target of and tool for advertising.

Once upon a time my argument for _paying_ for products when open source versions were readily available was that paid products were higher quality and that developers ought to be compensated for their work. Since customers are now also products, the first is no longer true. The second is a thing that seems to be happening considerably less. Already profitable businesses are now [regularly laying off](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/wffo5u4am) the people who made them profitable.

And so vim / neovim, with their decades of developer-centered development and a large community of enthusiasts, seems like a much better choice. It is more aligned with my values and needs, and (I hope) developer-driven instead of investor-driven.

Stepping into Neovim proper, as unfamiliar and clumsy with it as I am, just _feels_ better. It feels like a respite.
