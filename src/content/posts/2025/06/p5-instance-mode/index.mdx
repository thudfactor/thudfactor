import SimpleDemo from "@components/animations/SimpleDemo/index.astro";

For the uninitiated, [P5](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript implementation of the [Processing](https://processing.org/) programming language. For the Very Olds among us, Processing is a bit like [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>). That is: a simple language geared towards producing art.

Every so often I give P5 a poke or two because I find generative art (the non-AI kind) fascinating. Usually I do this on CodePen ([here's a fractal tree](https://codepen.io/elfinjohn/pen/eYxBeEL)), but I really want to roll it into this site.

However, P5 is written with the basic learner in mind and there's a lot of stuff set up with the expectation that you're just going to set up a P5-exclusive project and go. It uses a classic mode of JavaScript development, putting everything in a global space and depending on correct sequencing of source-file downloads. Which is nice, but it means the simple approach is hostile to integration with other frameworks, build tools, and JavaScript.

Fortunately, P5 has an "instance mode" and a `npm` package, but getting these to work required a bit of digging. I don't _think_ either is mentioned in the official documentation. You have to go look up [instance mode](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode) in their wiki.

## OK, what I did

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), but I think this process is going to be pretty similar if you have some sort of build process. This assumes you have an existing node project.

Add to your project with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5) or similar; for example: `npm i p5`. You can then import into your source files with `import p5 from "p5"`.

I use TypeScript[^1], so at this point my project started barking at me about missing types, but the error message was a new one on me:

```text
Could not find a declaration file for module 'p5'. '[...]/node_modules/p5/dist/app.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.

There are types at '[...]//node_modules/p5/types/p5.d.ts', but this result could not be resolved when respecting package.json "exports". The 'p5' library may need to update its package.json or typings.
```

I solved this by adding a separate type project (`npm i --save-dev @types/p5`). It seems to work, but there's probably a better way.

When you `import p5 from "p5"` you get a class you can instantiate:

```js
import p5 from "p5"

const sketch = new p5((p5) => { [...] })
```

The constructor accepts a single argument function that you can then use to call all of P5's methods. It will also take a second argument: an element to use as a render target.

Here's a simple, complete example:

```js
import p5 from "p5";

// For clarity's sake, I like to store the sketch in a variable
const sketch = (p: p5) => {
  p.setup = () => {
    p.createCanvas(200, 200);
    p.background(128);
  };

  p.draw = () => {
    p.stroke("rebeccapurple");
    p.strokeWeight(50);
    p.point(100, 100);
  };
};

const target = document.getElementById("Target");

if (target) {
  new p5(sketch, target);
}
```

That will get you this:

<SimpleDemo />

In "global" mode, P5 looks for `window.setup()` and `window.draw()` functions. It's not going to find those, so it will then switch to "instance" mode and run the `setup()` and `draw()` functions defined on the P5 instance created by the constructor.

There's no need to kick off the animation. P5 will start automatically, just as it does in global mode.

## Working with Classes

If you want to follow [Daniel Shiffman's advice](https://natureofcode.com/random/#the-random-walker-class) and turn your animation elements into separate classes, you'll need to pass the P5 instance to your class constructors for them to have access:

```js
class Walker {

	constructor(p) {
		this.x = p.width / 2;
		this.y = p.height / 2;
		this.p = p;
	}

	show() {
		this.p.stroke(255);
		this.p.strokeWeight(10);
		this.p.point(this.x, this.y);
	}

  [...]
}
```

Shiffman doesn't do this in his examples because he still has P5 running in global mode, so all of the P5 functions are defined in the global space.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone, somewhere, assuming a search engine chooses to show my website at any point. ðŸ¤£

[^1]: I know I said [I don't like TypeScript](/posts/2025/06/i-like-javascript/) but it helps in a complex codebase.
