## Cohort

Friends in blog places.

- [Infyo](https://infyo.me/) isn’t a blog _per se_, but if you are interested in modern YoYo (and who isn’t), there’s a lot of good beginner information here.
- [FilmOptimist](https://filmoptimist.blog/) C. Glen Williams’s media commentary is fun; this blog is the companion to their YoutTube channel, which tends to do _extremely_ deep dives on, for example, [Captain America](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0KNo7dSX9klzj-indE4KC8bUm__GQYMl).
- [Pelanne.com](https://pelanne.com/) posts interesting technical links with the absolute minimum of commentary. (None.)
- [Tom Yancey](https://thomasyancey.com/) doesn’t blog much, but his projects are always entertaining. For example, see his [Altered Chromatic](https://thomasyancey.com/#/projects/alteredchromatic) keyboard.
- [Jordan Seiler](https://jordanseiler.xyz/) wrote something quite useful about [Array.flatMap()](https://jordanseiler.xyz/posts/2023-04-30-flat-map/).
- [Toby Hagan](https://tobyhagan.com/) tackles some more difficult topics, like [how to build a scalable naming system](https://tobyhagan.com/blog/create-a-scalable-naming-system) in large infrastructure projects. This is more than just a function. It describes how to use Redis and serverless functions, so those names can be shared, and unique, across many services.
- [Solonor’s Inkwell](https://www.solonor.com) has been blogging for a very long time, although posts have dropped off in recent years (as they have for everyone).

## Me, Elsewhere

- [Film Hydra](https://www.filmhydra.com/) is my movie blog.
- [Elfin John](https://www.elfinjohn.com/) is my older portfolio blog.
