# Helpful 11ty Resources

Here are some pages or sites I found extremely useful for building this site in 11ty.

* [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev/) - A running collection of articles and web sites about 11ty development.
* [A Complete Guide to Building a Blog with Eleventy](https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html) - This got me started building my own blog and served as an excellent tutorial.
* [Organizing the Eleventy config file](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/) - Answered the question “do I really have to write all these shortcodes in the config file” with an excellent suggestion for how to not do that.
