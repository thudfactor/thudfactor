Hey, this is my “Now” page. [What the heck is a “Now” page?](https://nownownow.com/).

## Current projects

* Porting this blog to Astro and then redesigning it.
* Completing, or at least wringing a useful amount of entertainment out of, _Cyberpunk 2077_.
* Learning Italian.

## Reading (For Fun)

* [Double Whammy](https://carlhiaasen.com/books/double-whammy/), by Carl Hiaasen. A photojournalist turned private detective and his hermit pal investigate fraud and murder in the pro bass fishing world.

## Reading (Professional Development)

* [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/my-new-book-slow-productivity/), by Cal Newport. Newport explains how and why to replace pseudo-productivity (or “busy-ness”) with actual productivity. Crucial reading for scrum masters and product owners, I think, even if the words “agile” and “scrum” aren’t in the title.
