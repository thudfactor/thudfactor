Recently my mostly-remote company held a few days of in-person social and work events. It was nice to be able to see people, but it came at a cost. Because I am hearing impaired[^1] I couldn't _hear_ anyone. This wasn’t a problem just for my participation. The experience left me feeling isolated, exhausted, and very self-conscious.

[^1]: Some people object to the phrase “hearing impaired” and prefer the alternative phrasing “hard-of-hearing.” [According to the National Association for the Deaf](https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-frequently-asked-questions/), “hearing impaired” suggests that the person is incomplete or broken, while “hard-of-hearing” does not. For my part, I can’t see a dime’s worth of difference between the two.

I don't have this problem with video conferencing. I can carry on conversations and participate in meetings. Since I am a scrum master, facilitating meetings is a daily responsibility and I have no problem. Running the meetings in person, however? That depends heavily on the acoustics of the space I am in and the willingness of people in the room to project their voice.

Scrum practitioners often bemoan our now-remote lifestyle. "Things were so much better in person," they say. Not for me, they're not. In fact, not for a lot of people.

But it's hard getting around the fact that co-location is a part of capital-A Agile orthodoxy. My CSM instructor emphasized many times that a scrum team was _both_ "cross-functional" and "co-located." When I suggested that video conferencing tools like Zoom had made it really easy to get many of the benefits of co-location without actually requiring everyone to be in the same office, he became visibly upset.

"It's not the same thing," he insisted, making the arguments we've all become familiar with from corporate Return-to-Office initiatives: better communication, better collaboration, an increase in "synchronicity," and improved transparency and observability.

LeSS (Large Scale Scrum) even insists on everyone working in the same office space:

> Each team is co-located in the same room. This might sound unreasonable. Wouldn’t you, in today’s globalized world, want to use the best skilled people in the place where they are? No. We want the best teams that can take a shared responsibility for the outcome of the Team, and learns from each other. Shared responsibility requires trust. Humans build up trust quickest by close cooperation and face-to-face communication. Co-location also promotes team learning—the essence of continuous improvement.
>
> <cite>[LeSS Teams](https://less.works/less/structure/teams)</cite>

All humans? Or just certain ones? And even if this were true, is it true _all_ the time? Do we need to be face-to-face all the time? Why isn't video-conferencing face-to-face? What makes you think people have to be physically close to collaborate closely?

These are the questions any agile practitioner needs to have good answers for before they insist everyone working together in one big room is the best way to go, because it seems to me that open offices exclude many people by default.

## Are our office spaces really accessible?

One of the last offices I worked in before going fully remote had a split-level design. A short staircase separated the work space from the common areas. There was an elevator that could be used between floors, but it was slow and using it required entering and exiting a stairwell through two heavy, non-automatic fire doors. Most of us could jog down these handfuls of steps without thinking about it. But when my colleague was recovering from knee surgery, every visit to the restroom, main conference room, or kitchen became an elaborate dance with crutches.

Then, the elevator was out of service for several days…

“Old buildings have a lot of problems,” you might be thinking — but this office space was new construction, and we were the first tenants. Buildings are not often designed with accessibility in mind. Federal requirements improve this somewhat, but those boil down mostly to a list of checkboxes — with little thought given about the interplay between elements or the complete user experience of any particular space.

Small and large organizations alike continue to manufacture new accessibility problems in the physical space. For example, in 2017 Virginia Tech built a staircase up a short hill but did not include a ramp, forcing people who _can’t_ use stairs to use a much longer, circuitous route.

> Ashley Shew, a professor of science and technology in society at Tech and co-founder of the caucus, said there are several problems with getting around the campus. When she has to teach classes anywhere but the Upper Quad, there are challenges to getting up and down the hill that take her on winding paths around buildings.
> "If I get tenure, I'll spend decades walking around every building on this campus," said Shew, who is an amputee and has hearing loss. "You feel like a second class citizen when you have to take the long way."

> </cite>

A spokesperson for Virginia Tech defended the choice in a way that was both patronizing and dismissive:

> "We are not in Kansas," [Mark] Owczarski said. "This is not a flat place."

Again, the staircase was new construction. And it should not have come as a surprise to any construction planner that Blacksburg is not flat or that some people struggle with stairs.

Designing for disabilities is hard, especially since there are a lot of different ways people can be disabled. One example that demonstrates how many things we take for granted actually present a barrier for common disabilities is the design of Gallaudet University in Washington DC. Gallaudet is a school for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, so the physical spaces are quite different from the typical space. There are sliding doors so that people communicating with sign language don't have to stop their conversation to walk through a door. Hallways are broad so people signing can stand further apart -- to better see the signing. Corners in the hallways are round, not sharp, because deaf people cannot _hear_ someone coming from the other direction, and a round corner improves visibility. (<cite>[99% Invisible: DeafSpace](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-50-deafspace/transcript)</cite>)

Even if the building is well-designed for disabilities, the office layout frequently isn't. Open office spaces have many obstacles. Often the spaces are cramped, which means there's not much room for people to navigate with a wheelchair, cane, or other support devices. Hip, trendy office spaces that either are or look like converted industrial space with lots of concrete and exposed pipes create horrible, echoing environments that confound even the best hearing aids.

	conference rooms constantly asking the rest of us to keep the noise down.
</ArticleFigure>

The hustle and bustle of those open spaces present significant chances to many people who are neurodiverse. But since these spaces are designed to be noisy and push people together into spontaneous conversations, you could argue neurodiversity is excluded by design. But we don't actually have to go that far, because there's increasing evidence that open office spaces don't work for large majorities of the working population.

In other words, the extreme co-location advocated by LeSS and many agile practitioners disables many people.

## Disabled people vs. disabling situations

The traditional way to think about disability is that there are normal people, and then there are people who are physically or mentally lacking in some way that makes it impossible for them to do things "normal" people can do. Joan is disabled because she cannot walk. I am disabled because I cannot hear without assistance.

A different way of looking at disability suggests that much of disability is sociological and circumstantial. That is, spaces and processes _create_ circumstances that disable people when they are designed for a narrow band of capabilities. Joan, who relies on a wheelchair, is not disabled until the elevator is out of service. As I write this, I am not disabled because I don't _need_ to hear anything.

<Pullquote>Much of disability is sociological and circumstantial.</Pullquote>

This can be a hard idea to wrap your head around, but you can get a sense of how this works if you wear glasses or contact lenses. If you could not wear them, how well could you operate? Could you drive? Could you read your email? Could you decipher someone's scrawl on a whiteboard?

I am willing to bet that most of the people you know wear either contact lenses or glasses -- at least sometimes. This was not the case for much of history, and not just because lenses were hard to come by or expensive. If you have simple vision problems or a weak single-vision lens prescription, chances are you wouldn't even notice you were vision impaired three hundred years ago. But now most of our society is organized in a way that requires precision vision at any distance. It's not so much "your bad eyes" as it is "we have to read a lot of shit."

As far as hearing is concerned, I am not disabled when I am working remotely from my home office. This is because I have multiple strategies for coping, many of which are built into the tools used for video conferencing. You might not think of a volume control as assistive technology, but I certainly do. And, imprecise as it is, auto-captioning during meetings is a huge help.

I don't have those tools in person.

I do have hearing aids, but those are still an imperfect solution. Many people might imagine that hearing aids work much like glasses, restoring at least most of normal hearing, but that's not the case. And here in the United States, they are breathtakingly expensive and often not covered by insurance. I consider it evidence of "privilege" that I am able to afford them at all.

<Pullquote>Open office spaces are designed for a narrow band of human capability.</Pullquote>

This means when I am "in the office" that I am very much at the mercy of my employer and their attention to details like acoustics and amplification. Generally speaking, these things are not a priority in most office buildings. As a result, when I am in an office space I cannot generally hear the surrounding people. I am excluded from many conversations, miss important details in meetings. Furthermore, because I frequently don't respond when someone out of my eyeline asks me a question, my hearing problems are misconstrued as unfriendliness. ("I didn't realize you were deaf," a colleague told me once. "I thought you were just stuck up.") Since I ask people to repeat themselves often, or misunderstand things people say, some people assume I am stupid.

I can do my job in a well-designed, traditional office. I cannot do it in an open office space. It is not that I am incapable, it is that open office spaces are designed for a narrow band of human capability. You don't have to be deaf, though, there's increasing evidence that open spaces work for almost no-one.

## Open offices don't do what they claim to do

There’s a growing body of evidence, though, that open offices actually [lead to worse outcomes](https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices):

> Even in open spaces with colleagues in close proximity, people who want to eschew interactions have an amazing capacity to do so. They avoid eye contact, discover an immediate need to use the bathroom or take a walk, or become so engrossed in their tasks that they are selectively deaf (perhaps with the help of headphones). Ironically, the proliferation of ways to interact makes it easier not to respond: For example, workers can simply ignore a digital message.

Imagine being so _committed_ to the idea that everyone should be communicating that "engrossed in their tasks" is considered a _bad thing_.

Left to their own devices, developers will often choose to work individually for solid stretches of time. I know for me that the attraction of programming is how easily I can become engrossed, a state of mind Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls "Flow" and Cal Newport calls "Deep Work."

That CSM instructor was also very much against the idea of asynchronous communication. If you have a question you need an answer to, he explained, you should go _talk_ to that person immediately. If you couldn't see them in person, then you should pick up the phone and call. As a Scrum master, he said, I should encourage developers to do this — and if they didn't, immediately walk them to that person’s space or pick up the phone.

<Pullquote>More often than not, asynchronous communication is just fine.</Pullquote>

Practically the end result has a large chance of being asynchronous anyway. If our target is away from their desk, or in a meeting, there's not much else you can do but leave a message. If you do manage to catch them, however, it's no doubt you are an interruption. You've placed yourself and your priorities above whatever it is the target is doing at the time. Sometimes that's warranted, but often it really isn't.

This insistence on getting answers immediately is also very strange for a project execution framework that tightly controls when new work can enter the workstream and what the team's attention is supposed to be on. This "focus for me but not for thee" attitude is a part of Scrum I've actively discouraged in my own practice. More often than not, asynchronous communication is just fine.

Of course, the whole theory of co-location is that you are immediately available to anyone walking by, as well as (presumably) alert to all conversations happening around you. This attitude seems actively hostile to concentration, whether you're neurodivergent or not.

The end result is that _most_ people in an office are fighting distraction most of the day because the designed space is deliberately designed to maximize interruptability and availability, with focus only a secondary concern. The end result is a workspace that requires a super-human capability to regain lost focus, tolerate intentional interruption, and resist distraction. I do not argue that ADHD is entirely sociologically constructed, but it is apparent that these highly distracting environments disable many people, who then assume their inability to work is a personal failing rather than an entirely predictable consequence -- if not actually the purposeful result -- of the designed space.

## Did we misunderstand the value of synchronicity at work?

In _Deep Work_, Cal Newport describes the office spaces where concentration and synchronicity were _both_ supported as following a "hub and spoke" design — areas of quiet, small (even sound-proofed!) office spaces joined by large common areas — hallways, lounges, cafeterias — where people from different disciplines would naturally be mixed together. This is _very_ different from the current model, which is often all hub, with occasional small focus rooms or [work pods](https://myofficepods.com/office-pods/hushfree-s-phone-booth/) for people to go on the off-chance they need to think about something.

The important detail here is that these hub-and-spoke workplace designs are multimodal. They start from the assumption that people need focus in order to work, but encourage mixing in the spaces between. Open-offices assume that the bulk of the work gets done in the common area with private spaces are limited to occasional use. That is, assuming they are available at all. It is a unimodal approach to work, and everyone is expected to perform in the same environment, working the same way.

Fully remote work combined with regular and easily-accessible video-conferencing mimics much, if not all, of the hub-and-spoke workspace design. In some cases, it's even _easier_. Video conferences can handle arbitrarily small or large groups of participants without any conference room conflicts. For those of us with other needs -- with ADHD, anxiety disorders, hearing or vision loss, or mobility issues -- we are more free to create the kinds of workspaces we need without impinging on other people's work styles or space.0

</ArticleFigure>

What the hub-and-spoke or fully remote office designs are _incapable_ of reproducing is the performance of business which can be mistaken for effective work. That is, as a manager of an open work space you can see and hear whether people are at their desks coding, or standing at white boards collaborating, but this is much more difficult if people have individual offices, cubical, or work from home. You must instead rely on the quality of the work product, which is an uncomfortable position for managers who are time-and-efficiency focused or assume their subordinates will slack off if not supervised.

Incidentally, mistaking busyness for productivity is a [common failure mode of Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-velocity-productivity).

Perhaps the greatest evidence that open offices are a failure for the general working population is that office workers have been resisting return-to-office mandates, and that those mandates are generally created by C-suite executives that would never consider themselves chained to their desk.

> The new world of work has no time for technological holdouts and leaders who let the digital transformation pass them by now grapple with the realities of being out of touch. “The reason they want to have people back in the office is ‘fill in the blank,’ but usually it’s about how they feel like they don’t have their finger on the pulse of the organization,” says Slack SVP Brian Elliott. <cite><a href="https://www.awarehq.com/blog/return-to-office-resistance-top-companies-bridge-disconnect">The Truth About Return to Office Resistance and How Top Companies Bridge the Disconnect</a></cite>

In fact, RTO policies so often drive people away that companies have deployed them [as an alternative to layoffs](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/a-leading-remote-work-expert-says-amazon-s-rto-order-is-about-backdoor-layoffs/ar-AA1rwhki). The folks most likely to leave are the senior employees and high performers, which are also (coincidentally?) the ones who are most likely to be expensive troublemakers. Employees who quit, of course, don't get the severance they'd be entitled to in a layoff. When you get to the point where you are forcing people into poor working conditions _because you want a third of them gone_ it's hard to take any of the arguments about the supremacy of the open office seriously.

## So how should teams work, then?

There's a lot of emphasis in Scrum on having self-organizing teams. This is usually intended to mean that the teams figure out on their own how to balance work between themselves, how to organize the work, and identifying the tasks required to complete the work. But I can think of no _more important_ part of self-organization than also letting the team decide _how_ they work. Perhaps it is in the same room! Maybe it is remote! Maybe some team members like to sit together in a small office while others feel more comfortable and effective when they can control the surrounding activity. Agile teams should not be funneled into a single mode of working.

	most human beings.
</Pullquote>

With that said, we should also remember that our office spaces are often hostile to neurodivergent and
disabled people in ways that are not immediately obvious. Companies and managers need to be sensitive
to these problems. If you do require everyone to be in the office, look around. Does your floorplan automatically
exclude anyone in a wheelchair? Do you have amplification in large conference rooms? If so, are people
skilled enough to use it and do they use it consistently? Are there sufficient quiet spaces for people
who _need_ quiet to work?

Workplaces that claim they are committed to diversity and insist they are trying to provide the best workspace possible need to take into account not only the needs of the workforce they have at the moment, but also the needs of employees they have yet to hire. And these workspaces need to support employee productivity -- which might require different strategies for different employees in different situations. Workplaces that look busy but keep employees distracted don't support careful thought, concentration, or deep work. They are instead, frustrating, disabling, and hostile to most human beings.

Agile practitioners, for their part, need to recognize that open workspaces and co-location often work _against_ the goal of a highly productive team working at a sustainable pace. This kind of work can and does happen remotely, sometimes more effectively than it did in person. And working from home offers opportunities to a much more diverse workforce comprised of people who might otherwise be entirely excluded from your traditional office space.
