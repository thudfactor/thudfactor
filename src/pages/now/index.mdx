Hey, this is my “Now” page. [What the heck is a “Now” page?](https://nownownow.com/).

## Current projects

- Learning Godot 4
- Learning Italian.

## Reading (For Fun)

- [The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/83469/the-coming-of-conan-the-cimmerian-by-robert-e-howard/), by Robert E. Howard. The original Conan stories, published in the order they were written and without any of the “improvements” made over the years.

## Reading (Professional Development)

- [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/my-new-book-slow-productivity/), by Cal Newport. Newport explains how and why to replace pseudo-productivity (or “busy-ness”) with actual productivity. Crucial reading for scrum masters and product owners, I think, even if the words “agile” and “scrum” aren’t in the title.
