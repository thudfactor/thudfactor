Hey, this is my <q>Now</q> page. Woot. [What the heck is a “Now” page?](https://nownownow.com/).

## Current project

Making this site. I’ve got a lot of work to do, but that’s OK. I’m looking forward to using Web Components and writing CSS in as-close-to-plain-CSS as I can tolerate.

## Reading (Professional, Growth)
