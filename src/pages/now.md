Hey, this is my <q>Now</q> page. [What the heck is a “Now” page?](https://nownownow.com/).

## Current project

* Delving again into creative coding (AKA “Generative Art”), this time working with HTML Canvas
* Working on a “snake” game using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript with my teenager

## Reading (Professional, Growth)
