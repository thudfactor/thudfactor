Oh hi, this is awkward. I am…

  <span>Under Construction</span>

So this has been my site since, oh, somewhere around 2000. I started it out as a sort of blog kind of thing, and then kept it that way for a long time. Shut it down a few years back and focused my attention on [Filmhydra](https://www.filmhydra.com/), a movie review site. I also have a [professional portfolio site](https://www.elfinjohn.com/) that I haven't updated in too long.

Over the years, this has been a custom built site, run off Moveable Type, Wordpress (Multiple Times), Textpattern, Joomla, Drupal (Multiple times), SquareSpace, Medium, Hugo, Tumblr, and … now … [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Although blogging is a hobby, my _profession_ is web development and sometimes that means I get distracted by the platform.

It will get bloggy around here eventually, I think, assuming I can stop tinkering with the engine long enough to write something.
