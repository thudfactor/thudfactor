Hey, this is my <q>Now</q> page. Woot. [What the heck is a “Now” page?](https://nownownow.com/).

## Current project

Making this site. I’ve got a lot of work to do, but that’s OK. I’m looking forward to using Web Components and writing CSS in as-close-to-plain-CSS as I can tolerate. (Until Firefox gets its shit together and supports [CSS Nesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/), I will need at least some PostCSS. [Seriously, Firefox](https://caniuse.com/?search=nesting).)

## Reading (Professional, Growth)

* [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/) by Andy Hunt. It’s a bit long in the tooth, but still pretty useful. I might not have restarted this weblog without it.
* [Joy of Living](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/115218/the-joy-of-living-by-yongey-mingyur-rinpoche-and-eric-swanson/), by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche

## Reading (For funsies)
