description: The conventional wisdom is that you should not use pixel units, but maybe sometimes you should?

When I posted the early stages of my redesign at the end of February, someone on Mastodon said I should change the CSS of my main container to use `em` units instead of `px` because it’s “more accessible.”

About that.

I’ve been doing this web development thing for a bit now, and sure, I’ve heard that line for years. Believed and used it, too.

The conventional wisdom is that you should convert all of your absolute units (like pixels) to relative units like `em` or `rem` so people who like to use a larger font size won’t have their choices overridden. And we’ve been doing that for years. I’ve even made a few SASS mixins in my time to automatically convert pixel values into `rem` units, and have for many years diligently converted every `px` in my codebase to `rem`. Even the border widths.

`1px` is generally `0.0625rem`, by the way.

_But_ I hate putting tools out of use without a super good reason, and so I’ve been wondering — is there a place for pixels?

I think there is. In fact, I think pixels work best under most circumstances.

I’ll spoil the ending for you: relative sizes are great for fonts and line-spacing, but for other elements like padding, margin, borders, and layout sizes, pixels may actually be preferable.

That’s because browsers offer _two_ different ways of scaling fonts.

## A Tale of Two Zooms

Some time ago — quite some time ago, in fact — browsers standardized on “page zoom.” If you use zoom right now in Safari, Firefox, or Chromium browsers (Arc, Edge, Chrome, Opera) you will notice everything on this page gets bigger, despite the fact that I’ve used a mixture of `px` and `rem`. Zoom in far enough on the desktop and you will start to see the mobile layout of this site.

All of the browsers determined that zooming in and out was a critical enough accessibility issue that it couldn’t be left up to the entire Web to retrofit font sizes to `px` or `rem`. So: setting margins, padding, and font sizes in pixels doesn’t disable zoom anymore, and it hasn’t in a long time.

On the other hand, browsers let you set the default base font size. “Normal” here is `16px` (with some exceptions).

Here in the browser appearance settings in Chrome you can set the base font size independently of page zoom.

Chrome has their font size settings buried pretty deep in the settings. Safari binds text-only size increases to `⌘⌥ +` / `⌘⌥ -`. Firefox has a “zoom text only” toggle in the zoom menu. If you’re so inclined you can try those out now here on this page. What you should see is that changing the font size alone makes the text on this page bigger or smaller, but the layout doesn’t change otherwise.

<p style="font-size: 16px">This text, on the other hand, ignores the font size changes because I’ve set the font size in pixels. So it remains true that setting the font size in pixels overrides the user’s expressed preferences. The standard page zoom, on the other hand, won’t make this paragraph look any different from the others.</p>

<ArticleFigure image={TextZoomBroken} alt="A screenshot of this page, with the browser text size set to “very large.”">
Here’s what it looks like on my computer if I set the font size setting to “very large” in Chrome. The font sizes set in `rem` or `em` scale, but the paragraph set in `px` stays the same regardless.
</ArticleFigure>

This behavior is possible _here_ because I’ve set margins, padding, and responsive container sizes controlling layout to rely on pixel values, while keeping font size and line heights relative.

If, however, you follow the conventional wisdom (“`px` units are evil”), the end result is that changing the base font size _alone_ works exactly the same way as page zoom _already_ works.

You are re-implementing page zoom, which is pointless. But you are also _removing_ the ability for users to change font size independently.

Where does this leave us? Well.

1. **Sizing everything using `px`** satisfies [WCAG 2.1 1.4.4](https://wcag.com/designers/1-4-4-resize-text/) through [technique G142](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G142) as long as people use one of the very common browsers with “page zoom.” People who want to resize text independently of layout are just out of luck.
2. **Sizing everything using `rem`** satisfies the same requirement through [technique C28](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C28) and [technique G146](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G146), but since that’s _already_ met by browser page zoom, resizing text independent from layout is impossible.
3. **Mixing `px` and `rems` deliberately** satisfies accessibility requirements through [technique G179](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G179), _as long as access to all of the content and functionality remains available_. It’s the only choice that supports both page zoom and text-only zoom.

The third option is the most difficult. If you go this route, you have decide what should scale with font size and what shouldn’t. That’s many new judgement calls and a lot more testing. Maybe you don’t want or can’t support that. But it does preserve your visitors’ ability to scale text independently of your layout.

It also demonstrates why following conventional wisdom banning specific practices without regard for context has unintended consequences and leads to pointless complexity.

That, at least, is my thinking for this project. Am I wrong? Perhaps I am wrong. Maybe conventional wisdom is conventional for good reason, and my attempt to support text-only preferences is the real waste of time and resources. I’d love to hear your opinions on the matter, so [let me know on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@thudfactor).
