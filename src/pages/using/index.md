_Thudfactor_ is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) in mostly HTML, CSS, and maybe a tiny touch of Javascript.

My editor is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), my programming font is [Monaspace](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace#monaspace). My color theme is [Material Theme Darker High Contrast](https://www.vscolors.com/themes/45bfc9eb-5e03-487f-bffe-315fa6881d6a-098bf801) but I might switch that out for something with a punchier name. My OS of choice is Commodore KERNAL, but since thatâ€™s wildly impractical these days I just use MacOS.

The site is hosted by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and is continuously deployed from Github.

My favorite pen is an [Elite 95S in Burgundy](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-E95S-Fountain-Pen-Burgundy-Ivory-Fine-Nib/pd/12467), but I also regularly use tend to use a [Kaweco AL Sport in Iguana Blue](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/kaweco-al-sport-fountain-pen-iguana-blue) or a [Copper Kaweco Liliput](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/kaweco-liliput-fountain-pen-copper), inked with [Diamine Oxblood](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/diamine-oxblood-ink-cartridges) or [Diamine Ancient Copper](https://www.jetpens.com/Diamine-Ancient-Copper-Ink-30-ml-Bottle/pd/13085).
