Hi!

I hate writing these things.

My name is John Williams, and I am not a composer or a conductor. Sorry about that — it disappoints a lot of people.

Actually, funny story about that. For as far back as I can remember people have made jokes about me writing the music for _Star Wars_. Occasionally people mix it up and say _Harry Potter_ or _Jurassic Park_. But a few months ago I went through a Dunkin’ Donuts drive-through to pick up an order I made through their app. It puts only part of my name on the order sheet, “JOHN W” or some nonsense. The young guy at the window says “hey, what’s your name again?”

I say “John Williams,” and I think _here it comes again_.

He laughs and says says “I was hoping it was John Wick!”

It’s always nice to hear a new one.

Anyway, I am John Williams the _web developer_. I’ve been making web sites almost from the start. I am so old my earliest sites pre-date CSS. Heck, they pre-date `<table>` — I remember the earliest debates about table layout. “Tables are for data,” said one side. “But how else can we get a sidebar?” said the other, and that side persevered until better options were available.

Because there _was_ no typical path towards web development, I came to the industry sideways through typesetting. I worked summers at my hometown newspaper using QuarkXPress to reproduce ad layouts. We’d print those on a very high-resolution printer, then I’d take a razor blade and [adhesive wax machine](https://www.forgottenartsupplies.com/?what=artifacts&image_id=46&cat=53), cut the ad out, and stick it to a broadsheet paper to send off to the camera room. It was an odd mix of technologies, but it worked pretty well. The Web became commercially relevant just as I was graduating from college, so the newspaper hired me to make and run their first web site. This I built with the aid of [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and [UserLand Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software), building the site anew each morning with a script and pushing the new pages up through a 9600 baud modem connection.

The web has changed a lot since then. It’s become professional and specialized. For most of my career I’ve stayed in the front-end publishing end of web development, but in the last few years I’ve slid over to the UI Engineering side of things.

It has always been a struggle to keep up with this _still_ nascent industry, but here in the 2020’s things have really picked up speed. It’s the most exciting time since the birth of the Web, and I am thrilled to still be here learning new things every day and sharing them as much as I can with the small circle of people around me.

I’m also dedicated to agile development processes, serving as my team’s Scrum master. I get to add letters after my name in some contexts. Those letters are [“A-CSM” and “CSPO.”](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/jwilliams194)

Like that very first newspaper web site, _Thudfactor_ is built using a scripting toolkit with only static pages pushed up to the web host. You can read more about that on my [Using page](/using). For a more up-to-date sense of what’s going through my head, you can check out the [Now page](/now).
