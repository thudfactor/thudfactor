I am really excited to say that the update to _Thudfactor_ that posts this _also_ removes PostCSS from the blogâ€™s build processes. For ten years, give or take _n_, I've relied on a number of post-processing tools to make writing complex CSS a lot more managable. For most of that time it was SASS. I moved to PostCSS once I started using CSS Custom Properties, which solved most of my need for variables in my CSS. Newer selectors like `:has`, `:is`, and `:not` have made a lot of branching logic in CSS unnecessary. And now, with CSS Nesting part of the standard and well-adopted by all major browsers, my only excuse for using PostCSS has evaporated. I can now ship the CSS I write without any extra work.

To celebrate, I wanted to make note of several other strategies that have (thankfully) faded into distant memory.
