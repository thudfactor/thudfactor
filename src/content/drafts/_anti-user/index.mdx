I mentioned in my last post that I had just installed Ubuntu on my Windows PC. Things have not proceeded much farther from there; it's a lot of work to set up a new computer, never mind a new and unfamiliar operating system. I do, however, like it a heck of a lot better than Windows. For starters, I didn't have to go through Ubuntu's settings for three hours turning off all of the places where Microsoft has created settings that give them the right to sell your activity to other people so they can more effectively advertise at you on the desktop. For all their faults, Apple has not gone down the same sell-their-customers path.

It's the old "if something is free, you're the product" thing again. Increasingly, however, you can just leave off the conditional. No matter what you are paying, you're the product.

It's depressing to see so many services and applications simply _stop caring about their users_. It increasingly feels like we have to fight everything to use the software or service we've subscribed to. The UI is not designed to simplify the [user journey](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-journeys-vs-user-flows/), but instead to redirect us, distract us, push us into activities we'd otherwise not be interested in. How often do you open an app on your phone to get a quick task done and end up stuck in a tour of new features, dismissing announcements, or trying to bat away marketing garbage to get at the One Thing that app is supposed to do?

This is not what UX is supposed to be, and yet…

	"vision journey" started five decades ago, thank you.

Surely some of this stuff happens under protest, but I also think designers have gaslit themselves
into thinking they're doing us a favor sometimes. "We have all these great new features," is the
thinking. "We need to let people know all the stuff they can do now."

But maybe I don't want (for example) to set and track a reading goal in my e-reader. I have fifteen minutes, I want to read my book for fifteen minutes.

But often it feels like what a company has in mind is their own priority, not mine. I want to know if Netflix has a movie I want to watch, but if they don't, do I get a straight answer? No! I get a lot of alternatives instead.

Just give me zero results.

It is _extremely difficult_ for me to read the article I am on the site to read when an unrelated video is autoplaying, chasing me down the page as I try to scroll away. Does anyone think we want this? They would have to be deluded.

iTunes didn't always do something the way I wanted it to, but for a very long time it did what I needed and that was _let me play my music_. The same with Kindle. It's hard to remember now, but there was a time when the Kindle app opened up and showed you the book you were reading, _not_ all the things you could buy instead. Streaming services would put your watchlist front-and-center, not bury it under several layers of menus or "suggested for you" nonsense. But it's all so exhausting now.

I know I am not the only one irritated by this, because I can hear my spouse trying to read an article on a magazine's website. It sounds like this:

"No. Go AWAY. Stop. FUCK OFF. SHUT UP, NO!"

	It's a good thing I know who all three of these authors are. Otherwise, if I picked up
	Abercrombie's grimdark fantasy "Best Served Cold" expecting "Guards, Guards" I'd be really
	surprised.

Why are we fighting every damn step of the way?

Free and open-source software has been around for ages, of course, offering an alternative to corporate, paid products. The bargain there was: it may be more frustrating to install, and harder to use, and have a worse customer experience, but _it's free_. And also you can do a lot of cool stuff with it if you have the skills and interest to tinker.

As a developer who likes getting paid for his work, however, I've never begrudged someone a bit of cash for a well-polished proprietary product. I give you money, you make things easy for me. And pleasant.

For the most part that's not the way things work anymore. The services we use keep getting more and more expensive as they get worse, more intrusive, less portable, less powerful. Cory Doctorow calls it [Enshitification](https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2), but to the Googles and Amazons and Netflixes of the world it's _increasing shareholder value_.

(Fucking Kroger, by the way. They put displays all over the store, in the middle of the aisles, creating _intentional_ choke-points. Our Kroger is the size of a small planet, but it's next to impossible to walk through because you have to keep dodging displays or other people dodging the displays. I always leave with a headache and furious. Their solution? I should pay them an annual fee to deliver my groceries to me instead. Aldi's solution? _Don't put shit in people's way._ We shop at Aldi.)

If I am going to swear at my computer, I'd rather be swearing at it for not working the way I expect. I'd rather have the hope of it someday, if I am smart enough and clever enough, having it do what I want it to do precisely the way I intend. More and more I find myself thinking: open source is frustrating and a lot of labor, but at least they are not _selling my data_ and _actively getting in my way_.

All of which is a long way of saying I'm becoming a convert. [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) is a lot uglier than Kindle, but at least when I open the app it shows me my damn books.
