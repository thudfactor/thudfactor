## Generators and Tools

[SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
: SVG tool for cleaning up, compressing, and simplifying SVGs. I often use this after exporting an SVG from a tool like Figma.

[Josh Comeau's Shadow Palette Generator](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/)
: Generate nice looking, naturalistic drop shadows in CSS.

[Wakamai Fondue (font analysis)](https://wakamaifondue.com/)
: Web app that can analyze a font file and tell you lots of stuff about it, including the color palettes (if any) and what axes are available.

[Flexbox Labs](https://flexboxlabs.netlify.app/)
: A great way to try out different flexbox properties and see what they do; familiar iconography might help make the dubiously intuitive property names stick in your head a little better.

[Anchoreum](https://anchoreum.com/)
: Similar to above; an interactive playground for anchor-based positioning. (Browser support is chrome-only at the moment, but on the roadmap for Firefox and Safari.)
