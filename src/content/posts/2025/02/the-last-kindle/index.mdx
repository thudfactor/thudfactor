I bought my last Kindle book on February 12. It was Hunter S. Thompson's _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_. I didn't know it was my last Kindle book at the time; shortly afterwards I saw a post on social media from someone saying they went to download one of their books from the website and there was a notice saying Amazon was dropping support for that functionality.

I'm not precisely sure when I bought my first book from Kindle, but I know it was sometime in 2007. It was Richard Dawkins's _The God Delusion_. I've never finished the book because there's a bit in there where Dawkins explains that he doesn't need to _know_ anything about religions other than Islam or Christianity because they are all lies, and at that point I realized he was full of shit and I didn't need to read anything else he had to say either. (Some arguments are a double-edged sword.)

I just checked, and I don't actually have that book backed up anywhere. Which is no great loss. I do
have about 1400 others, though, downloaded and indexed and backed up, along with a quarter-century
of Audible purchases, digital versions of all of my CDs (in FLAC) as well as the digital purchases
I've made over the years, and a sizable portion of my movie library. That digital movie library is a
reflection of my physical collection, which literally surrounds me in my office here at home.

Amazon was once a great and innovative force in the ebook world, but long after it became obvious that they were a bad actor and an exploitative company I continued to buy from them. Part of it was ecosystem lock-in, part of it was convenience. Kindle DRM has been pretty easy to work around, and the syncing across multiple devices -- and sometimes with the audiobook version! -- was pretty hard to let go of. But making it more difficult to manage my own copy is a dealbreaker for me, no matter how disruptive or inconvenient it is.

The collector's mindset is stronger in me than any other concern.

## An opportunity to reflect

This disruption in my patterns of consumption and hoarding has forced me to think a bit, though. While talking about breaking ties with Kindle, I told a friend of mine: "If 95% of my media library disappeared, it probably wouldn't make any difference. I just don't know which 5% would."

It's not as easy as weeding these collections out; things that are not important to me today, I've learned, can be very important to me tomorrow. I have a deep concern that I will not be able to lay hands on something again when I want it, and feel a considerable amount of satisfaction when I can produce some oddity from my bookshelf. Libraries and rentals don't do this for me because I have to _give those back._ And the DRMed, digital, licensed, quote-unquote purchase (that isn't really) is even _worse_ because these things disappear silently… and you don't know it's gone until you go looking for it.

I'm always disappointed when I go get a movie off my shelf and discover disc-rot has set in, but knowing something in my library has disappeared because someone decided I shouldn't have it anymore is intolerable.

A lot of other collectors know what I am talking about, but I am beginning to recognize this mindset is pathological. Many of these books, albums, and movies I will never engage with again. Many of them I've never engaged with the first time. If they are physical goods, they take up space in my house. I worry about them getting damp, getting damaged, getting sun-bleached. If they are digital goods, storing them costs time and money. I get to worry about hardware failures, redundant backups, databases, delivery systems.

Physical or not, these goods _weigh_ on me. They take up space in my head, if not my house. They are ether-clutter. It is brain pollution. I need to stop. I need to revisit the media I already own. And yet…

And yet.

I pre-ordered a new book today.
