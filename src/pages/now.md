Hey, this is my <q>Now</q> page. Woot. [What the heck is a “Now” page?](https://nownownow.com/).

## Current project

Making this site. I’ve got a lot of work to do, but that’s OK. I’m looking forward to using Web Components and writing CSS in as-close-to-plain-CSS as I can tolerate. (Until Firefox gets its shit together and supports [CSS Nesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/), I will need at least some PostCSS. [Seriously, Firefox](https://caniuse.com/?search=nesting).)

## Reading (Professional)

[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/) by Andy Hunt. It’s a bit long in the tooth, but still pretty useful. I might not have restarted this weblog without it.

## Reading (For funsies)

I _just_ finished [The Light Fantastic](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/books/the-light-fantastic/) by Terry Pratchett and am now at loose ends. I’ll need to find something soon.

## Watching

- A bunch of movies staring The Spanish Lon Cheney, [Paul Naschy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Naschy).
- [Star Trek: Lower Decks](https://www.startrek.com/shows/star-trek-lower-decks)
